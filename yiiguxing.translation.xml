      <item value="Annotation which indicates that a method parameter should be bound to a web request parameter. &lt;p&gt;Supported for annotated handler methods in Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux as follows: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;In Spring MVC, &quot;request parameters&quot; map to query parameters, form data, and parts in multipart requests. This is because the Servlet API combines query parameters and form data into a single map called &quot;parameters&quot;, and that includes automatic parsing of the request body. &lt;li&gt;In Spring WebFlux, &quot;request parameters&quot; map to query parameters only. To work with all 3, query, form data, and multipart data, you can use data binding to a command object annotated with {@link ModelAttribute}. &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the method parameter type is {@link Map} and a request parameter name is specified, then the request parameter value is converted to a {@link Map} assuming an appropriate conversion strategy is available. &lt;p&gt;If the method parameter is {@link java.util.Map Map&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt;} or {@link org.springframework.util.MultiValueMap MultiValueMap&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt;} and a parameter name is not specified, then the map parameter is populated with all request parameter names and values." />

      <item value="Schedules the specified task for repeated &lt;i&gt;fixed-delay execution&lt;/i&gt;, beginning after the specified delay. Subsequent executions take place at approximately regular intervals separated by the specified period. &lt;p&gt;In fixed-delay execution, each execution is scheduled relative to the actual execution time of the previous execution. If an execution is delayed for any reason (such as garbage collection or other background activity), subsequent executions will be delayed as well. In the long run, the frequency of execution will generally be slightly lower than the reciprocal of the specified period (assuming the system clock underlying &lt;tt&gt;Object.wait(long)&lt;/tt&gt; is accurate). &lt;p&gt;Fixed-delay execution is appropriate for recurring activities that require &quot;smoothness.&quot; In other words, it is appropriate for activities where it is more important to keep the frequency accurate in the short run than in the long run. This includes most animation tasks, such as blinking a cursor at regular intervals. It also includes tasks wherein regular activity is performed in response to human input, such as automatically repeating a character as long as a key is held down." />
